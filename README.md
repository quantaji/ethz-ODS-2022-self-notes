# ETHz Optimization for Data Science Spring 2022 Self Notes
This is a repo for my self notes of this course. I choose markdown for its fast compile of math expression.




## How to read it
You can use `vscode` with `Markdown-All-in-One` extension or macOS/iOS app `MWeb` to view it. There are some bugs for math expressions on Github.

<!-- 
All math expression are inline, and start and end with ` `` `, e.g. ` ``\LaTeX`` ` shows as $\LaTeX$. 

The reason is that I use MWeb on Mac/iOS as Markdown Editor, and the default setting of ` $\LaTex$ ` show some bugs with absolute function `\mid`, `\|` or  `|`. I use this app (which is free) because it is convenient to export html and to pdf.

You can also read the Markdown in VScode. However, this is not the default for `Markdown-All-in-One` extension in VScode. You can use another extension, `Markdown+Math` and change delimiter to `Julia` by setting `"mdmath.delimiters": "julia",`. -->
